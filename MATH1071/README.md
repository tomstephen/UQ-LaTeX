# MATH1071-LaTeX

Theorems, Definitions, Lemmas and Proofs of the MATH1071 course presented in a neat LaTeX document.

## Getting Started

### Lecture Notes

A PDF file (as well as open source .tex file) is avaliable. Please refer to the completion.txt file to see what lecture has been written up.

If you plan to make changes, update the notes, or anything else, please make sure you note what lecture you changed in the completion.txt file.

## Prerequisites
### TO VIEW THE NOTES

As long as you have a pdf viewer (most browsers work as PDF viewers), you can view the .pdf files.

### TO EDIT THE NOTES

Make sure you have some distrubution of LaTeX installed on your computer (but really if you plan to edit it you would have already have done this...) and a suitable text editor to edit the files.
