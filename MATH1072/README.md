# MATH1072 - Advanced Multivariable Calculus and Ordinary Differential Equations
These are course notes written in LaTeX for the undergraduate mathematics course MATH1072 taught at the University of Queensland. Each section is divided by lecture and there are suitable pdf for viewing on both Desktop and Mobile. This is basically a more succint and direct MATH1072 workbook. Excluding figures as of... now

## Compiling LaTeX source code
To compile the latex document ending in .tex, you will need to have a distrubution of LaTeX based on your Operating System.

Some common options include:
* Windows - [MikTex](https://miktex.org/download)
* Linux - [TexLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)

You will also need something to edit it in like [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/). Download the .tex file and place it in a directory of choice. It is dependant on your editor but for TeXstudio, you can press compile to build the pdf file for viewing.

This whole section is useless. Espicially if I decide not to release the source code.
